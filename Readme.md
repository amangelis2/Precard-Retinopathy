# Precard Retinopathy Project

Welcome to the "Precard Retinopathy Project" project repository. This repository contains code related to the analysis of retinopathy data. 
The project focuses on retinopathy baseline extraction, data imputation, data exploration, progression dataset creation, analysis of progression, and generating tables for publication.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into the following sections:

### 01_Retinopathy_Baseline_extraction

In this section, the baseline data related to retinopathy is extracted. 
This data extraction process lays the foundation for subsequent analysis.

### 02_Retinopathy_data_Imputation

Here, the retinopathy data is prepared through imputation techniques. 
Missing data is handled to ensure a complete dataset for analysis.

### 02a_Retinopathy_Data_Exploration

This section involves the exploration of the retinopathy data to assist with imputation and other changes. 
Visualizations and exploratory analysis are conducted to gain insights into the characteristics of the data.

### 03_Retinopathy_progression_dataset

In this part, a dataset identifying and calculating retinopathy progression is created. 
This dataset captures the progression of retinopathy over time, enabling analysis of its development.

### 03a_Retinopathy_Progression_DTI_Analysis

Here, the progression dataset is analyzed. 
The analysis focuses on understanding the factors contributing to retinopathy progression using survival analytics. 

### 03b_Retinopathy_Tables_Publication

This section involves the generation of tables suitable for publication. The analysis results are formatted to meet publication standards and provide clear insights.
